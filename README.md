# LeadTracker

Welcome to LeadTracker, the fast, clean way to track leads with you team!

To start, add your leads by selecting the leads tab, or just click "get started".

Once your leads have been added, make sure you add all the sales reps on your team under the "reps" tab.

Lets start tracking interactions!

From here, you can click "interactions", and "create new"

CRITICAL: Make sure you select the correct LeadID and RepID for each interaction, which are visible from the corresponding index

After selecting the appropriate LeadID and RepID, enter an accurate description of the interaction.

Once created, you can track the date an interaction was created, and when it was modified.

TIP: Best practice is to log an interaction immediately after it takes place; remember you can always edit the description later!

Happy hunting!
